# 👋 Hi, I'm Sam

I'm a machine learning practitioner interested in explainable AI, small data challenges, and healthcare applications.  
My background is in linguistics, and I approach AI through a language and cognition lens, utilizing context through knowledge graphs, ontologies, and semantic web technologies.  

Currently based in Ghana, I’ve worked on projects ranging from clinical text classification to building semi-autonomous agents for legal reasoning.  
I care about making AI understandable and trustworthy for real-world users — especially in high-stakes fields like medicine.
